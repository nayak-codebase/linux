Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.


Steps to reproduce the assignment to discover vmx features
==========================================================

Install vmware fusion
In the settings of vmware fusion in processor and memory section, select checkbox to enable the hypervisor applications in the virtual machine.
Downloaded the ubuntu iso	
Installed git,make,gcc 
Clone the forked repo - https://github.com/nayak-codebase/linux
Create a folder inside linux ,cmpe283 and place the files Make and cmpe283-1.c  provided in the assignment 
cd  to cmpe283 folder
Edit the  cmpe283-1.c with querying vmx features
Run the command : make all
Load the module : sudo insmod ./cmpe283-1.ko
Unload the module : sudo rmmod ./cmpe283-1.ko
Print the logs to the file log_info.txt  : dmesg >  log_info.txt

Team Contribution

Praveen Prabhakar Nayak
	Researched Intel sdm document which was available from previous lectures, to identify the primary and secondary processor based controls.

	Created a struct object with the primary and secondary processor based capability information.
	To check if secondary processor based controls are available, implemented a function to check
     	if the 63 bit is set. This information was available in following SDM section
 	(A.3.3 Secondary Processor-Based VM-Execution Controls(A-4 Vol. 3D) 
	Made a call to this function from detect vmx features function.

Yadnyshree Savant
	Referred the Intel SDM to identify the entry and exit controls for VMX
	
	Created a Struct to check the entry and exit control capability information.  
	Added a call to the above from detect vmx features function.
	All the above was referred from Intel SDM volume 3C, section 24.8.1 Table 24-13
